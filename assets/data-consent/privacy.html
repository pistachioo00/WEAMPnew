    <h1><strong>Background</strong></h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Republic Act No. 10173</strong>, also known as the Data Privacy
      Act of 2012 (DPA), aims to protect personal data in information and
      communications systems both in the government and the private sector. It
      ensures that entities or organizations processing personal data establish
      policies, and implement measures and procedures that guarantee the safety
      and security of personal data under their control or custody, thereby
      upholding an individual’s data privacy rights. A personal information
      controller or personal information processor is instructed to implement
      reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal data against
      natural dangers such as accidental loss or destruction, and human dangers
      such as unlawful access, fraudulent misuse, unlawful destruction,
      alteration and contamination.
    </p>
    <p>
      To inform its personnel of such measures, each personal information
      controller or personal information processor is expected to produce a
      <strong>Privacy Manual</strong>. The Manual serves as a guide or handbook
      for ensuring the compliance of an organization or entity with the DPA, its
      Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), and other relevant issuances of
      the National Privacy Commission (NPC). It also encapsulates the privacy
      and data protection protocols that need to be observed and carried out
      within the organization for specific circumstances (e.g., from collection
      to destruction), directed toward the fulfillment and realization of the
      rights of data subject.
    </p>

    <h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
    <p>
      This Data Privacy Manual is a result of the Worker’s Affairs Office (WAO)
      to comply with <strong>Republic Act No. 10173</strong> or the Data Privacy
      Act of 2012, its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), and other
      related policies, including other NPC issuances. This may be reviewed and
      updated by the WAO based on the experiences and initial results of the
      ongoing implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Manual provides the basis for the Office and its employees to operate
      data security and protection measures and to integrate data security
      measures in the performance of their functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law requires the office and its employees to understand and apply
      basic data security principles of the Data Privacy Act, listed as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Transparency</strong>. The nature, extent, and purpose of data
        collection are made clear to all data subjects by WAO. Furthermore, the
        office must inform data subjects about the processing of their data and
        its implications on their right to privacy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legitimate Purpose</strong>. WAO is responsible for ensuring
        that all personal data processing has a legal basis or a legitimate
        purpose. The Data Privacy Act requires the office to make sure that data
        processing complies with the stated purpose of its programs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Proportionality</strong>. The WAO should limit its personal data
        collection, storage, processing, and usage to what is required to
        fulfill its program requirements or purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The office ensures that through this Manual all personal data collected
      from all its relevant data subjects and beneficiaries shall be processed
      in adherence to the general principles of transparency, legitimate
      purpose, and proportionality.
